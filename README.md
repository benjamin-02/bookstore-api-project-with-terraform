# Dockerization of Bookstore Web API (Python Flask) with MySQL

## Description

Bookstore Web API Application aims to create a bookstore web service using Docker to give students the understanding to dockerization of an application. The application code is to be deployed as a RESTful web service with Flask using Dockerfile and Docker Compose on AWS Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) Instance using Terraform.

## Problem Statement

![Project_203](203-bookstore-api.png) 

- Your team has started working on a project to create a `Bookstore` Application as Web Service.  

- Software Developers in your team have already developed first version of `Bookstore` application. They have designed a database to keep book records with following fields.

  - book_id: unique identifier for books, type is numeric.

  - title: title of the book, type is string.

  - author: author of the book. type is string.

  - is_sold: book availability status, type is boolean.

- Your teammates also created the RESTful web service as given in [Bookstore API](./bookstore-api.py) using Python Flask Framework. Below table shows how the HTTP methods are designed to affect the given resources identified by URIs.

| HTTP Method  | Action | Example|
| --- | --- | --- |
| `GET`     |   Obtain information about a resource | http://[ec2-hostname]/books (retrieves list of all books) |
| `GET`     |   Obtain information about a resource | http://[ec2-hostname]/books/123 (retrieves book with id=123) |
| `POST`    |   Create a new resource               | http://[ec2-hostname]/books (creates a new book, from data provided with the request) |
| `PUT`     |   Update a resource                   | http://[ec2-hostname]/books/123 (updates the book with id=123, from data provided with the request) |
| `DELETE`  |   Delete a resource                   | http://[ec2-hostname]/books/123 (delete the book with id=123) |

- You are, as a cloud engineer, requested to deploy the app in the development environment on a Docker Machine on AWS EC2 Instance using Terraform to showcase your project. To do that you need to;

  - Get the app code from GitHub repo of your team.

  - Create docker image using the `Dockerfile`.

  - Deploy the app using `docker compose`. To do so;

    - Create a database service using MySQL.

    - Configure the app service to run on `port 80`.

    - Use a custom network for the services.

- In the development environment, you can configure your Terraform config file using the followings,

  - The application should be created with new AWS resources.

  - The application should run on Amazon Linux 2 EC2 Instance

  - EC2 Instance type can be configured as `t2.micro`.

  - Instance launched by Terraform should be tagged `Web Server of Bookstore`

  - The Web Application should be accessible via web browser from anywhere.

  - The Application files should be downloaded from Github repo and deployed on EC2 Instance using user data script within Terraform configuration file.

  - Bookstore Web API URL should be given as output byTerraform, after the resources created.
